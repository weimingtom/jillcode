Jill is an implementation of the [Lua language](http://www.lua.org/), in pure Java.  Designed to run on JME (mobiles), but also runs on JSE.

The code that comprises the initial release (1.0.1) is owned by Nokia Corporation and has been made available by them under an open source license.  See [the COPYRIGHT file in the source](http://code.google.com/p/jillcode/source/browse/COPYRIGHT) for details.

[Ravenbrook Limited](http://www.ravenbrook.com/) originally wrote this implementation under a commercial contract (and it was later acquired by Nokia).  We are therefore in a good position to maintain it as an open source project, and of course we can offer commercial support or modifications.

We welcome community members with contributions to make.
